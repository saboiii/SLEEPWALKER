# SLEEPWALKER
A brave protagonist, the Sleepwalker, embarks on a perilous journey through surreal landscapes to conquer the Nightmares that plague the realm of dreams in pursuit of a peaceful nightâ€™s sleep.

I made this project for the UNITY 2D Game Development Workshop hosted by GIIS Tech Club. Feel free to access these files and use them for your own project :)

Please note that:
1) The game is mostly complete, but there are features like collection systems and saving highscore mechanisms that I omitted in the interest of time.
2) The Home and Restart buttons on the Game Over screen may not work.
3) The main menu screen art was made by AI, but all the remaining game art was made by me.
